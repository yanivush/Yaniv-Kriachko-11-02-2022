--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Didn't implemented due luck of time:
1. NO REDUX USED!! if you want to know why, ask me in person :)
2. toast - popup error messages
3. Bonus section
4. Maybe there may be some bugs..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did I start develop it?
1. First create simple local custom API service using C# WEB API which helped me to start with work data fetching (insted to work with limited accuweather api)
    and then after I had created pages with some stuff includes fetch , I have switched to accuwaether api..
3. Took time to work on funcional stuff
4. Graphic and styles was last step in this project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where I'll go with this?
I will continue to improve this weather web app and later will convert it into REACT-REDUX project - Just to make myself better programer
